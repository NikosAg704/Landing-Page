## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikosAg704/Landing-Page.git
Open index.html in your browser, or deploy using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.



📝 How the Contact Form Works
The form is connected to Formspree via a simple HTML <form> action URL.

When a user fills out the Name, Email, and Message fields and clicks Send Message, Formspree receives the data.

Formspree validates the input, blocks spam, and sends the message directly to your registered email.

No server or backend coding is required—everything works from the frontend.
